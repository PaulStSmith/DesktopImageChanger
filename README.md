# DesktopImageChanger
Updates the desktop image with a world map depicting the day/night cycle with the time when the program runs. 
Can be automated with a task scheduler.

If you are using the task scheduler to run this at specific times, 
you'll need to set the “Run only when user is logged on” option.
Because otherwise, due the way a task runs, the wallpaper will 
not be updated.

The image will be generated at the ```MyPictures``` special folder as either ```DesktopImage01.jpg``` or ```DesktopImage02.jpg```.

The desktop wallpaper image will be similar to this one.
